# sql-server


## Description 

This project is a back-end application for a employee tracking system. This application uses SQL database. I was able to learn and impliment all CRUD operations thorugh this project and test them using MYSQL. The biggest challenge with this project was to ensure that the data was being sent through the correct parameters. 

## Installation 

In order to use this application, clone the repository onto your computer, and install node. Login into the MYSQL Server and run the seeds and schema. Followed my npm run start. Follow the commands on the terminal

## Usage 

This application will allow the user to access the seeded data in the db folder and through the terminal allow the user to either add, modify or delete data within the database.
